This project involves the analysis and pricing of a First-To-Default (FTD) certificate using financial modeling techniques. The study focuses on determining the FTD spread based on a given set of Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads and recovery rates for two obligors. A detailed description of the problem and the methodologies employed can be found in the [report](https://github.com/alehowe/Certificate-Pricing/blob/main/Certificate_Pricing_HoweAlessandroJohn.pdf).
